A curated list of resources that can assist your backend development journey at Boot.dev

## Motivation

A frequent request in the Boot.dev discord community is "where can I learn more about x", or "are there any good books about y".
This repository is an attempt to answer those questions and provide a curated list of resources that can assist your backend development journey at Boot.dev.
It should be noted that this is not an official Boot.dev resource. It has been curated by the Boot.dev community, for the Boot.dev community.

### Goal
The hope is that this repository will be a living document and will be updated as new quality resources are discovered, or as existing resources become outdated.

## ü§òüèª Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have a resource that you think would be a good fit, and as this repo is part of a learning community, we encourage you to open a pull request to submit your addition since it tends to be difficult to get Git experience. If you have any questions, please reach out to the [Boot.dev community on Discord](https://discord.gg/EEkFwbv).
